# devops-template
For my MSc Dissertation at the University of Abertay, I have designed a lightweight DevOps pipeline to be used in organisations. This project is designed around being low-overhead and using mostly open sourced tools to streamline the efforts for small scale projects. I would love to hear feedback on this from anyone interested!
